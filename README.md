WSN-DS Machine Learning Project: Detecting Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN)
Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to classify various types of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) using the WSN-DS dataset. The dataset contains information on node attributes and labels representing different types of attacks and normal behavior. This repository includes code for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.

Dataset Description
Dataset Name: WSN-DS
Number of Rows: 374,661
Number of Columns: 19
Attributes: The first 18 columns correspond to the attributes of nodes, while the last column represents the node labels (normal or various DoS attacks).
Project Steps
The project is divided into the following steps:

Step 1: Data Acquisition and Preparation
Load the WSN-DS dataset.
Explore the dataset to understand its structure and statistical properties.
Preprocess the data by handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
Analyze the distribution of classes and address any class imbalances.
Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization
Perform comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset.
Use visualization techniques such as histograms, pie charts, box plots, pair plots, and correlation matrices to understand feature distributions and relationships.
Step 3: Feature Engineering
Extract relevant features and perform dimensionality reduction if necessary.
Prepare the dataset for model training by encoding categorical variables and scaling numerical features.
Step 4: Model Selection and Building
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Implement and train at least five classification algorithms: Na√Øve Bayes, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machine, KNN, and Random Forest.
Optimize hyperparameters for each model to improve performance.
Step 5: Ensemble Model Building
Choose an ensemble method (Bagging, Boosting, or Stacking).
Implement and train the ensemble model.
Tune hyperparameters and compare the performance with standalone classifiers.
Step 6: Model Evaluation
Evaluate the performance of each model using the testing dataset.
Generate classification reports, including precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy for each class.
Plot AUC-ROC curves and confusion matrices for each model.
Step 7: Conclusion and Recommendations
Summarize findings and compare the performance of different classification algorithms.
Discuss the significance of evaluation metrics and provide recommendations for selecting the most suitable model.
Suggest potential areas for further research and improvement.
